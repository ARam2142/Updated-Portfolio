# Updated-Portfolio

# Background:

This is an updated version from my first portfolio that i made a few weeks ago. This portfolio now includes projects that i have done in bootcamp. My porffolio inludes contact information as well as more bootstrap elements. The bootstrap helps out with making this mobile friendly. There is alot less css elements. The bootstrap definetly made life easier. Aside from you will be able to all of the work that i have done up until now!

# Technologies used:

Bootstrap,
CSS,
HTML

# Outcome:

This portfolio took me time to finish. This is the first timme ever using bootstrap. So I was familiarizing myself with its documentation. It was very new to me. However, this made styling very easy and less time consuming. I will definetly be using it more in the future.
